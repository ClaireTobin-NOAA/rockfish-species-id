Currently, there are multiple output genotype files from MICROHAPLOT for the five sequencing runs that I'm going to be analyzing here.

The sample ID numbers in those files are not unique identifiers by themselves (but are unique when combined with the GTseq run number). 

The sample ID is connected back to the NMFS DNA ID in the sample sheet.

My initial moves here will be to get those data into a reasonable format to make things easier down the line.

```{r }
genos_long %>%
  filter(gtseq_run == "GTseq63") %>%
  dplyr::select(id) %>%
  unique()

```
